BoJack Horseman Quotes Project
Welcome to the BoJack Horseman Quotes project! This project showcases some of my favorite quotes from the popular animated series "BoJack Horseman." I've utilized HTML, CSS, and Flexbox to create a visually appealing and interactive experience for fans of the show.

Features
Quote Display: Explore a curated collection of memorable quotes from BoJack Horseman.
The quotes:
1. In this terrifying world, all we have are the connections we make.
2. Eventually I stopped waiting for something to change me. I had to make the change myself.
3. It‚Äôs never too late to be the person you want to be. You need to choose the life you want.
4. You‚Äôve got to get your shit together.
5. The key to being happy isn‚Äôt to search for meaning. It‚Äôs to keep yourself busy with unimportant nonsense and eventually, you‚Äôll be dead.
6. I don't think I believe in deep down. I kinda think that all you are is just the things that you do.
7. The only way out is through.
8. I wasted so many years being miserable because I assumed that was the only way to be. I don‚Äôt want to do that anymore.
9. In real life, big gestures aren‚Äôt enough. You need to be consistent. You need to be dependably good. You need to do it every day.
10. You can‚Äôt keep doing shitty things and then feel bad about yourself as if that makes it all okay. You need to be better.
